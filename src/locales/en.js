    title: "About Me",
    description: `As a new student in computer science, I possess a solid coding foundation and am familiar with several key technologies. My programming skills are continuously improving; I have extensive experience solving problems using Java and C/C++, can complete basic machine learning tasks using Python, and enjoy using LaTeX for writing academic papers and creating posters. Through coursework, I've begun to engage with user-related topics, such as designing simple systems using Java, which has helped me better understand the fundamental principles of software development. Looking ahead, I anticipate further deepening my knowledge and expanding my skills, particularly in Web/App development, to become a more well-rounded programmer.`,
